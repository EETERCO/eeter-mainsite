## Asymmetric and compartmentalized

The minimal symbol is derived from letter “z”, incorporating several inherent values to the project such as: asymmetry, compartmentalization and stability of the structure. The visual metaphor of heavily abstracted and chat bubble provides relation to the communications sector. Although the chat bubble is a generic metaphor, we figured it’s subtle take works well on an international level rather than going with some deeper, tech-specific metaphors or not addressing the sector at all.

The logo consists of three elements used in two variations. The symbol, a full word mark and the shorthand abbreviation. This allows for a responsive use depending on the context or environment.​​​​​​​
