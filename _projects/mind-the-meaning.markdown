## Worlds oldest trademark

The idea for the symbol references the world’s oldest trademark – White Rabbit, a needle shop China, during the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279). It was used with a purpose for advertising and a warning against copying. In the spirit of the archaic trademark, this modern and likable symbol was born.
