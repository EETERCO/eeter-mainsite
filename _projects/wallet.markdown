## Simplifing the complexities

Decreditons GUI design focuses on simplifing interacting with the Decred blockchain. The most challaneging tasks have been translating complex features, usually done in a command-line environment, into clear and straightforward experience for novice as well advanced users. As users manage their funds in the wallet, the baseline principles aims to instill feeling of confidence and security. Create an environment of control and percision, where the users don't have to worry about making any mistakes what might loose their funds.

## Sense of stability

Structural arrangement of Decrediton creates relationships that unify the common features. The layouts are composed in a consistent and calm manner, creating memorable way of navigating. Main interactions are highlighted by color contrasts helping them to easily stand out. Numbers have a unique type treatment to help reduce the visual weight of displaying 8 decimals. Motion design provides an extra level of feedback as well holds the top level of hierarchy.

## Passing the learning curve

One of the biggest issues for Decred is it's learning curve. Since many of the considered for “advanced users” we’ve been constantly refining the onboarding process. This begins with a rich introduction in the launcher and continues through-out the app as well positioned tips providing insights. 

The current work focuses on various optimizations, mobile version and materializing the new features.
