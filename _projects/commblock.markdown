## Seeing through the hexagon blocks

The old symbol was plagued by number of issues, from similarities to other symbols as well graphical construction and performance. Due to being in action across critical domains, the task at hand required retaining a similar perception of the symbol. By constraining our work around the base form and inner workings of the hexagons, the updated symbol was based on intertwined hexagon duo what in combination formed an ambigram. We also injected additional value by emphasizing the C and the block formation. 

We worked out a set of common methods and assets for consistent visual branding across all outputs. The products received consistent icon based logos as well key visuals.
