## IO/01

The re-imagined identity for Coinscrum is formed around a typographic approach. A custom monospace wordmark drawn with distinctive characteristics is based on IBM Plex. The turnover of OI to 01 represents the relationship to the development sector as well serves as a historic reference to being the first major crypto meetup community.

## Highlighting each event
The bold wordmark together with the visual identity forms an approachable, trustworthy and recognizable output for the cryptocurrency and blockchain events community. 

A generative approach allows to increase awareness and communicate nuances of single events while instilling a clear brand association back to the source.

Each combination for hero visuals is essentially an exercise of creativity, composition and architectonics.
