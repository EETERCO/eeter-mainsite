Design consultant for digital matters and identity design. He advocates clear-sighted, functional and meaningful design performance.

  Since 2008 i've spent a fair share of time with several major design firms in Estonia, Finland, and Australia. Most of my work involves financial, tech and industrial sectors.

Nowadays much of my time is spent on designing interfaces, thinking over design systems, managing projects and working through all the insides and outs of product development.
