content1: "<p>We take on digital products from inception to continuous and new iterations
  as they evolve. \L\LTo ensure that all parties involved are on the same page, we
  create an actionable plan with priorities defined by value and effort, as well as
  the limitations considering risks and difficulties. This provides a clear sight
  of how much time and attention do different aspects require.</p>\n\n<p>We work in
  quick iteration sprints, where best outcomes and insights get distilled into more
  refined designs.</p>"
